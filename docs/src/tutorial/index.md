This tutorial shows the functionalities of *Extremes.jl*. They are illustrated by reproducing some of the results shown by Coles (2001) in [An Introduction to Statistical Modeling of Extreme
 Values](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9781852334598).

Before executing this tutorial, make sure to have installed the following packages:
- *Extremes.jl* (of course)
- *DataFrames.jl* (for using the DataFrame type)
- *Distributions.jl* (for using probability distribution objects)
- *Gadfly.jl* (for plotting)

and import them using the following command:
 ```@repl
using Extremes, Dates, DataFrames, Distributions, Gadfly
```
